# What did I learn?

## Week 1: C
1. What is a number system?
2. What are algorithms?
3. How a code is interpreted by a machine?
4. What happens when a code is run?
  * preprocessing, compiling, assembling, linking
5. Elements of a good code
  * correctness, style, design (readability)
6. How to debug a code? (need to learn more)
  * breakpoints, try-except,
7. What is a main function?
8. What is a header file? 
* stdio.h
9. What is a string datatype?
* typecast, null termination
10. Some basics 
* command line, data type (int, char, float, double), operators (*,/,+,-), conditional statements (if, if else, if else if), loops (for, while, do-while)
11. Functions: declaration, definition, call
12. Variables and scope: global and local
12. Command line arguments: argc, *argv
13. Arrays
14. Magic Numbers 

## Week 2: Algorithms
1. Searching algorithms
* linear search, binary search
2. Sorting algorithms
* insertion sort, bubble sort, selection sort
3. What is running time analysis or time complexity?
* big-O, omega, theta
4. Different types of time complexity
* O(1), O(logn), O(n), O(nlogn), O(n^2), O(n^c), O(c^n), O(n!), O(inf)
5. Programming techniques
* Divide and conquer
* Recursion
6. Merge sort- an improved sorting algorithm based on recursion

## Week 3: Memory
1. What are different components of memory?
2. What is stack memory? How it is used when functions are called?
3. What is heap memory? Why it is used?
4. Pointers
* \* and & operators
* deferencing a pointer
* null pointer
* things to take care when using pointer (every pointer should be linked to a pointee before usage), scanf example
5. Dynamic memory allocation
* malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), free()
6. What is stack, heap and buffer overflow? (need more detail)
7. File pointers
8. Hexadecimal system and why it is used?

## Week 4: Data Structures
1. What is a data structure?
2. What is struct datatype?
* user-defined (derived) datatype, typdef keyword, . operator, -> operator
3. What are limitations of array data structure?
4. Linked list
5. Stacks
6. Queues
7. Trees
8. Hashing
9. Tries
