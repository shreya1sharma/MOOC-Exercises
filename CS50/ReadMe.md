# What did I learn?

## Week 1: C
1. What is a number system?
2. What are algorithms?
3. How a code is interpreted by a machine?
4. What happens when a code is run?
  * preprocessing, compiling, assembling, linking
5. Elements of a good code
  * correctness, style, design (readability)
6. How to debug a code? (need to learn more)
  * breakpoints, try-except,
7. What is a main function?
8. What is a header file? 
* stdio.h
9. What is a string datatype?
* typecast, null termination
10. Some basics 
* command line, data type (int, char, float, double), operators (*,/,+,-), conditional statements (if, if else, if else if), loops (for, while, do-while)
11. Functions: declaration, definition, call
12. Variables and scope: global and local
12. Command line arguments: argc, *argv
13. Arrays
14. Magic Numbers

## Week 2: Algorithms
1. Searching algorithm
* linear search, binary search
2. Sorting algorithms
* insertion sort, bubble sort, selection sort
3. What is running time analysis or time complexity?
* big-O, omega, theta
4. Different types of time complexity
* O(1), O(logn), O(n), O(nlogn), O(n^2), O(n^c), O(c^n), O(n!), O(inf)
5. Programming techniques
* Divide and conquer
* Recursion
6. Merge sort- an improved sorting algorithm based on recursion

## Week 3: Memory
